== Installation ==

There are several ways to install a plugin in WordPress. For newbies this way is highly recommended:

1. Navigate to 'Add New' under 'Plugins' menu in admin area
1. Upload or choose `wp-meta-description.zip` from 'Install Plugins'
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

For correct working make sure that your site visibility isn't blocked. You can find this option under 'Privacy' in 'Settings' menu. Prevent to intall more than one plugin for the same task. Prevent double entries in the header and values which are in conflict to each other.
