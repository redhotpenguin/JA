Uses your current theme to display login, registration and profile pages instead of the WordPress look and feel.

== Description ==

The Customize Your Community (CYC) Plugin for WordPress was conceived by [Sugarrae](http://www.sugarrae.com/) will help you theme your backend WordPress pages using your existing WordPress theme and will not show obvious traces and branding of Wordpress on the registration, lost password, login and logout pages to all users. Additionally, the CYC plugin will also theme profile.php pages for all registered users that are labeled as "Subscribers" in your administration panel as well as redirect "Subscribers" to their profile page upon login, bypassing and hiding the traditional WordPress dashboard".

It also adds in the possibility to show a [captcha](http://www.white-hat-web-design.co.uk/articles/php-captcha.php) on the registration form.
