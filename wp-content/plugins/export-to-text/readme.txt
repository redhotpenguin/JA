== Description ==

A simple plugin to export WordPress post data into a tab-separated text file format (TSV).

This plugin allows you to copy and paste your data into Excel or download the data in a TXT file.

If your goal is to extract all the main post fields (including custom fields) into text with each row representing 1 post, then check this out.

* Export your data in an Excel-friendly format
* Easily move your posts in text between WordPress installs when used in-conjunction with CSV Importer ( http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/csv-importer/ )
* Make quick backups of your posts and save them in a text file
* Download your data as a TXT file

We built this plugin so we could have more control over our WordPress data without getting our hands dirty with XML and MySQL.

We support data freedom and believe all systems should make user's data more accessible.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `export-to-text/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
