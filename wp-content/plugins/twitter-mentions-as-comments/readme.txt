Twitter Mentions as Comments scours Twitter for people talking about your site & silently inserts their Tweets alongside your existing comments.

== Description ==

Twitter Mentions as Comments does exactly what it promises to do - scours Twitter for people talking about your blog posts and silently inserts their Tweets alongside your existing comments. The plugin leverages the power of WordPress's built-in commenting system - notification, comment moderation, author white/black listing - making Twitter an extension of your blog.

= Features = 
* Searches for Tweets linking to your blog posts, regardless of the URL shortener used (using Twitter's Search API)
* Pushes Tweets into WordPress's existing comment workflow - notifications, comment moderation, and author whitelists/blacklists work just like any other comment
* Fetches user's real name and profile picture and links directly to the original Tweet
* Checks automatically - no need to do a thing
* Option to automatically exclude ReTweets
* Option to store tweets as trackbacks/pingbacks
* Option to specify which posts to check (e.g., 10 most recent posts, all posts, front page only)
* Smart Caching of Tweets and user data - retrieves only what it needs to save on API calls and server load

= Planned Features = 
* Dynamic resizing of Twitter profile images to fit WordPress theme
* Prioritization of newer posts
* Oauth Authentication to raise API limit (currently unlimited Tweets, but limited to 150 *new* comment authors per hour)
* Smarter API throttling

**Please note that this is an initial release** and is not intended for use in all environments. It works for me, but that's about all I can guarantee right now. Any feedback you can provide in the comments section of the [Twitter Mentions as Comments Plugin Page](http://ben.balter.com/2010/11/29/twitter-mentions-as-comments/). 
 to improve the plugin is greatly appreciated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Wouldn't it be great if..., I keep getting this error message, etc. =

It probably would be. Please let me know on the [Twitter Mentions as Comments Plugin Page](http://ben.balter.com/2010/11/29/twitter-mentions-as-comments/).
 
= It keeps finding my own Tweets. Is there an easy way to blacklist a Twitter user? =

Yes. Because Tweets go through WordPress’s built-in comment moderation system, if you navigate to Settings -> Discussions and add “[your Twitter username]@twitter.com” to the blacklist, your Tweets should not appear (or anyone else’s you want for that matter).
