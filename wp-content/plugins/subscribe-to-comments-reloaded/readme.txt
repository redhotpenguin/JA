Subscribe to Comments Reloaded allows commenters to sign up for e-mail notifications of subsequent replies.

== Description ==
Subscribe to Comments Reloaded is a robust plugin that enables commenters to sign up for e-mail notification of subsequent entries. The plugin includes a full-featured subscription manager that your commenters can use to unsubscribe to certain posts or suspend all notifications. It solves most of the issues that affect Mark Jaquith's version, using the latest Wordpress features and functionality. Plus, allows administrators to enable a double opt-in mechanism, requiring users to confirm their subscription clicking on a link they will receive via email.

## Requirements
* Wordpress 2.9 or higher
* [Proper Network Activation](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/proper-network-activation/), if you're planning to use it in a multiblog environment
* PHP 5.1 or higher
* MySQL 5.x or higher

## Main Features
* It does not modify Wordpress system tables
* You can manage all the subscription with its handy admin panel
* It imports Mark Jaquith's Subscribe To Comments data (**copies but does not delete** the old data)
* All the messages are fully customizable, no poEdit required (and you can use HTML!)
* Available in multiple languages
* It ignores Spam comments
* It's compatible with [Fluency Admin](http://deanjrobinson.com/projects/fluency-admin/) and [QTranslate](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/)
* It has a truckload of options to customize its behavior

== Installation ==

1. If you are using Subscribe To Comments by Mark Jaquith, disable it (no need to uninstall it, though)
2. Upload the entire folder and all the subfolders to your Wordpress plugins' folder
3. Activate it
5. Customize the Permalink value under Settings > Subscribe to Comments > Options (first field). It **must** reflect your permalinks' structure
5. If you don't see the checkbox to subscribe, you will have to manually edit your template, and add `<?php if (function_exists('subscribe_reloaded_show')) subscribe_reloaded_show(); ?>` somewhere to your `comments.php`
6. If you're upgrading from a previous version, please make sure to deactivate/activate the plugin
7. Optional: customize all the messages under Settings > Subscribe to Comments > Messages
