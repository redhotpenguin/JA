	RE CHRIS NOTES:
		The backup file listing shows a lot of "Unknown" strings. Considering that some of the listings have seven unknowns, the information becomes muddled and difficult to read.
			Unknown should only be displayed for old backups (hopefully). Any suggestions on cleaning this up for backups that lack this data?
		PclZip issue
			Unable to replicate.
			This error is thrown here.  From your log this means that fopen must have returned a false for some reason for you.
				1953 if (($this->zip_fd = @fopen($this->zipname, $p_mode)) == 0)
				1954 {
				1955   // ----- Error log
				1956   PclZip::privErrorLog(PCLZIP_ERR_READ_OPEN_FAIL, 'Unable to open archive \''.$this->zipname.'\' in '.$p_mode.' mode');
				1957
				1958   // ----- Return
				1959   //--(MAGIC-PclTrace)--//PclTraceFctEnd(__FILE__, __LINE__, PclZip::errorCode(), PclZip::errorInfo());
				1960   return PclZip::errorCode();
				1961 } 
		After adding a destination, it appears that the only thing that happens is that the inputs empty. I have to scroll to the top of the dialog to see that something has actually happened. The same thing happens when modifying an existing destination except that the inputs do not clear out after submission. If the submission is to be handled by Javascript and not a fresh page load, then the page should be automatically scrolled to the top so that it is clear that the action did something.
			Unable to replicate. Forms submit without javascript and the action goes back to the same page with an anchor to the same tab so it should be going to the top.
		When selecting an existing remote destination, what if I want to use a different path? An option should allow for customizing the path without requiring modification of the remote destination (if the destination is used for backups and the user forgets to change it back after the migration, then their new site will start to fill with backups). The feature should support supplying new FTP information without creating a new destination.
			The entire remote destination system needs refactored and really needs to be done to make this doable without severe rigging.
			As a workaround I've added the ability to duplicate destinations for now until the destination system is redone.
		Backup listing actions inconsistent. For example clicking the backup filename on the migration page shouild start migration instead of downloading the archive. @see Chris' suggestions for handling this. - re: Chris

MINOR ISSUES NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
	Magic migration inclusion of importbuddy means the migration no longer matches WordPress styling when still inside WordPress. - Cody
	Getting Started page far-right column hanging off page edge slightly still. - Dustin
	It could be helpful to redirect or display help information on using ImportBuddy or RepairBuddy after clicking to download the script.
		Re-evaluate how this currently works to implement this. This would be helpful for guiding users.
	Capitalization in S3 bucket names seem to be ignored when copying. Not sure why this would happen yet. - re: Chris
	Magic migration:
		If sending to remote destination and the file already exists then don't overwrite without confirmation. @see Chris suggestions on handling this. - re: Chris
	Ability to resume imports/migrations. - re: Chris
