1. Download the plugin, unpack it and upload the '<em>specialrecentposts</em>' folder to your wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings -&gt; Special Recent Posts to configure the basic options.
4. On the widgets panel, drag the Special Recent Posts widget onto one of your sidebars and configure its specific settings.
5. You're done. Enjoy.

If you wish to use the Special Recent Posts in another part of your theme which is not widget-handled, you can put the following snippet:

`
<?php
	if(function_exists('special_recent_posts')) {
		special_recent_posts($args);
	}
?>
`
where $args is an array of the following options:

`
// Post Type (default: 'posts')
srp_post_type => post/page

// Post Status ('publish|private|inherit|pending|future|draft|trash)
srp_post_status_option => text

// Custom Post Type (text)

// The Widget Title (default: 'Special Recent Posts')

// Display thumbnails? (default: yes)
srp_thumbnail_option => yes|no

// Thumbnail Width
srp_thumbnail_wdg_width => numeric

srp_wdg_excerpt_length_mode   => chars|words|fullexcerpt

// Select display order. (default: DESC)
srp_order_post_option => ASC|DESC

// Want to randomize posts order? (default: no)
srp_orderby_post_option => rand|no

// Post Offset (to skip current displayed post from visualization)
srp_post_offset_option => yes|no

// Global Post Offset ( to skip an arbitrary number of posts from the beginning)
srp_post_global_offset_option => numeric

// Insert the category ID to filter result posts. (default: -1|'' = none)
srp_filter_cat_option => numeric

// Choose wheter to display only title or both title and excerpt. (default: titleexcerpt = displays both title and text 5)

`

Example:
Show last 5 posts in random order without thumbnail. (PHP mode)
`
<?php
// Defining widget options.
$args = array(
	'srp_number_post_option'  => 5,
	'srp_orderby_post_option' => 'rand',
	'srp_thumbnail_option'    => 'no'
);


// Function call.
special_recent_posts($args);
?>
`

If you wish to use a shortcode, put the following inside any of your post/pages:
`[srp]`

Shortcodes parameters names are the same of direct PHP call ones, but you have to put them with the '=' sign instead of the '=>' arrow.
String values must be enclosed within single/double quotes.

Example:
`[srp srp_number_post_option='5' srp_orderby_post_option='rand' srp_thumbnail_option='no']`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin works but i see no thumbnails =

This issue might be caused by several problems. Check the following list.
<ol>
<li>Thumbnails are rendered using the PHP GD libraries. These should be enabled on your server. Do a phpinfo() on your host to check if they're installed properly. Contact your hosting support to know how to enable them.</li>
<li>Another problem could be that you're hosting the plugin on a MS Windows based machine. This will probably change the encoding data inside the files and could lead to several malfunctions. Better to host on a Unix/Linux based enviroment.</li>
<li>External images are not allowed. This means that if you're trying to generate a thumbnail from an image hosted on a different domain, it won't work.</li>
</ol>

== Requirements ==

In order to work, Special Recent Posts plugin needs the following settings:

1. PHP version 5+
2. GD libraries installed and enabled on your server.
