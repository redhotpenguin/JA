<p><em>&#8220;For those who choose to interact and connect on the web, the profile(s) we create are how we reference ourselves. <strong>Our online identity defines who we are in terms of what we do, what we say and who and what we are connected to.</strong> While many choose a pseudonym as their profile, rather than their &#8220;real name,&#8221; that profile is still attached to what that person says, does, and IS on the web. <strong>It is this association that provides authenticity, which enables relationships, conversation and connection.</strong>&#8220;</em></p>
